# Overivew 
This repository is **the first scenario of** a seriers of code templates(examples) to demonstrate how to use java Spring framework for data access (insert/update/delete/read) with Cassandra NoSQL database. This series contains the following scenarios:
1. Use ***Spring Boot*** and ***Spring Data for Cassandra*** for basic CRUD operations (single-column primary key) on simple data types (text, int, etc.) through Rest APIs. 

   For this scenario, there is NO special configuration for Cassandra such as user authentication or client-to-server SSL/TLS encyption, etc.

2. Use ***Spring Boot*** and ***Spring Data for Cassandra*** for more advanced CRUD operations (composite primary key) on more complex data types (UDTs, collections, blobs, etc.) through command line interface. 

   For this scenario, user autentication is enabled for Cassandra.

3. Use ***Spring Boot*** and ***DataStax Enterprise Java Driver*** to take full potentials of all advanced features as provided by the DataStax driver APIs that are not avaible through Spring Data for Cassandra (or at least in simple and straightforward way), such as flexible load balancing policy, retry policy, connection pooling, more robust object mapping, and a lot more. 

   For this scenario, user authentication and client-to-server SSL/TLS encryption are both enabled for Cassandra.

For all scenarios, DataStax Enterprise (DSE) version 5.1.11 is used as the Cassandra database.

Please **NOTE**:
Among these scenarios, **the third one of using Spring Boot and DataStastx Enterprise Java Driver is the recommended approach**. The first 2 approaches, due to its usage with Spring Data for Cassandra, have some limititations that can't be easily addressed and may cause some issues when connecting to Cassandra.

# Code Description

## Spring Boot Project Dependency

The code project for this scenario is Gradle based. To help simpilfy and speed up Spring Boot application development, the basic project structure and dependency can be simply built up from Spring Initialize Web UI (https://start.spring.io/), which will create a zip file that can be downloaded and imported into local Java IDEs (e.g. IntelliJ) 

For this scenario, there are two dependencies required for the Spring Boot application: Web and Cassandra. Correspondingly, the generated "build.gradle" file has the following 2 dependency lines.

```
dependencies {
	implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra')
	implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')
}
```

The Spring Boot version used in this scenario is version **2.1.0**.

## Cassandra Schema

For this scenario, the following Cassandra keyspace and table are used (the keyspace replication strategy can be changed to whatever is needed), as defined in "schema.cql" file. The main table is used for keeping track of available books with their titles and authors. 

```
CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS springbootcass WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}  AND durable_writes = true;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS springbootcass.book (
    id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
    author text,
    title text
);
```

## Cassandra Connetion and Rest API Port

As with many Spring Boot based applications, "application.propertities" file defins many Spring Boot application behavior related settings. For this scenario, it has the following properties:
* The first 3 propertities define how to connect to Cassandra
* The last property defines what is the Tomcat web server port for this application's Rest API.

```
spring.data.cassandra.keyspace-name = springbootcass
spring.data.cassandra.contact-points = 127.0.0.1
spring.data.cassandra.port = 9042
server.port=8088
```

## Rest APIs and Testing

The following Rest APIs are defined in this scenario:

| Rest API Endpoint | Method | HTTP Payload | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| /api/books | GET | None | Retrieve all saved books from Cassandra table |
| /api/book/{id} | GET | A long value (as book ID) | Retrieve a specific book from Cassandra table |
| /api/book | POST | A JSON document that defines a book | Insert a book into Cassandra table |
| /api/book/{id} | PUT | <ul> <li> A long value (as book ID) </li>  <li> A JSON document that defines a book </li> </ul> | Make an update to a book in Cassandra table |
| /api/book/{id} | DELETE | A long value (as book ID) | Delete a specific book from Cassandra table |
| /api/books | DELETE | None | Delete all books from Cassandra table |

### Testing Rest APIs with Postman

When starting to run this application (e.g. from the IntelliJ IDE), Spring Boot will start an embedded web server that listens on the port (8088) as configured in "application.properties" file. In order to test the Rest APIs, I'm using Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/).
